# Symbiotic-Agent
Project Name: Symbiotic Agent (A Hybrid Symbolic-LLM Agent for IoT Rule Validation)

Description: We present the Symbiotic Agent, a novel hybrid architecture for the Rule Interaction Threat (RIT) validation task. Unlike pure LLM agents, it integrates a deterministic symbolic analysis layer (for guaranteed logical coverage) with a contextual LLM adjudication layer (for semantic reasoning). This symbiosis allows it to achieve state-of-the-art precision and robustness, demonstrating a scalable blueprint for reliable AI agents in safety-critical domains.
